OSGi Application Frameworks shows a Java developer how to build frameworks based on the OSGi service platform. OSGi, an emerging Java-based technology for developing modular applications, is a great tool for framework building. A framework itself, OSGi allows the developer to create a more intuitive, modular framework by isolating many of the key challenges the framework developer faces.    This book begins by describing the process, principles, and tools you must master to build a custom application framework. It introduces the fundamental concepts of OSGi, and then shows you how to put OSGi to work building various types of frameworks that solve specific development problems.    OSGi is particularly useful for building frameworks that can be easily extended by developers to create domain-specific applications. This book teaches the developer to break down a problem domain into its abstractions and then use OSGi to create a modular framework solution. Along the way, the developer learns software engineering practices intrinsic to framework building that result in systems with better software qualities, such as flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability.

Together, they\'re an amazing combination.    Flexible Rails is a book about how to use Ruby on Rails and Adobe Flex to build next-generation rich Internet applications (RIAs). The book takes you to the leading edge of RIA development, presenting examples in Flex 3 and Rails 2.    This book is not an exhaustive Ruby on Rails tutorial, nor a Flex reference manual. (Adobe ships over 3000 pages of PDF reference documentation with Flex.) Instead, it\'s an extensive tutorial, developed iteratively, how to build an RIA using Flex and Rails together. You learn both the specific techniques you need to use Flex and Rails together as well as the development practices that make the combination especially powerful.    The example application built in the book is MIT-licensed, so readers can use it as the basis for their own applications. In fact, one reader has already built an agile project management tool based on the book example!    With this book, you learn Flex by osmosis. You can read the book and follow along even if you have never used Flex before. Consider it \"Flex Immersion.\" You absorb the key concepts of Flex as you go through the process of building the application.

Shobana Jayaraman, ', 'Seam is an exciting new application framework based on the Java EE platform that you can use to build rich, web-based business applications. Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java enterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of use, transparent integration, scalability, and developer choice.    Seam in Action offers a practical and in-depth look at Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities in the Java EE architecture. It discusses the shortcomings of JSF, the challenges of using Java persistence in the web environment, and other common development roadblocks, then shows how Seam makes these problems just melt away. In covering Seam, the author doesn\'t just ask you to sprinkle annotations on your code and expect that you understand how it works. Instead, the author lays down the facts, shows you the steps, reveals the logic, and diagrams the flow, so that by the end of the book, you will not only have gained a deep understanding of Seam, but will also come away ready to teach the material to others.    All too often, developers spend a majority of their time integrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state, struggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions, and constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic pertaining to the business at hand. Seam in Action dives deep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these non-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5 annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.    To start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant application come together by the end of the second chapter. As you progress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates unnecessary layers and configurations and uses an inversion of control technical known as bijection supplemented by a liberal use of the Unified Expression Language (EL) to establish the missing link between JSF, EJB 3 and JavaBean components. You also witness how Seam opens doors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not had time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page flows (jBPM), rule-based security, Ajax remoting, PDF generation, Spring integration, and more.', '2008-08-01 07:00:00');

Driven by fear of being left behind, American corporations let IT grow until it reached one half of all corporate capital spending by the year 2000. Now, chastened by their spending failures, IT managers are converging on a new consensus: to exploit IT competitively they must use their smarts over big money.    This shift in thinking comes just as free, open-source software, low-cost international programming labor, and new technologies combine to make the new approach possible.    A former Research Fellow at Gartner, Keller had an insider\'s view of the irrational spending at many Fortune 500 companies, personally influencing billions of dollars of technology acquisitions.

As it advances, the new IT think will cause further massive disruptions in the computer business, with fundamental changes in the ways software is developed, sold, and used. Efficiency of IT investment will grow as excess fat is squeezed out of IT salaries, software system costs, and consultants\' fees.    In an unexpected twist, Keller argues that even as IT spending is reduced its importance for competitiveness will grow. Reduced spending does not mean IT has become a commodity.

One of the central premises of object-oriented programming is that each concern should be implemented as a separate module. However, there are certain system-wide concerns, such as logging, security, performance, and so forth, that often need to be addressed in many, if not all of the modules. Consequently, the code to handle these system-wide concerns may be mixed in with the core logic of a huge number of modules, resulting in lower productivity, poor quality, and systems that are hard to evolve.    Aspect-oriented programming overcomes these problems by modularizing the system-wide concerns.    AspectJ enables AOP programming in Java by adding a few new language constructs. By using Java as the base language and creating a final system that is compatible with Java byte code specification, AspectJ passes on all the benefits of Java. The use of Java as the base language also makes AspectJ a relatively easy language to learn.    AspectJ in Action is a practical guide to AOP and AspectJ. The reusable code examples that are provided will enable quick implementation of functionality in your system.    The book is divided into three parts. The first part introduces AOP and AspectJ and will be helpful to developers wanting to learn or advance their knowledge of AspectJ.

Working With Objects is the source on a method which takes an evolutionary step forward in object-oriented development practices. OOram adds the intuitively simple but powerful concept of a role to object-oriented models and methods. For example, imagine trying to describe a person as an object. The most effective way to do this would be to independently describe each of the roles that person adopts (parent, employee, and so on) and then define how the person supports them.

Based on the principles of dependency injection, interface-oriented design, and aspect-oriented programming, Spring combines enterprise application power with the simplicity of plain-old Java objects (POJOs). Now, Spring has grown into a full suite of technologies, including dedicated projects for integration, OSGI-based development, and more.    Spring in Action, Third Edition has been completely revised to reflect the latest features, tools, practices Spring offers to java developers. It begins by introducing the core concepts of Spring and then quickly launches into a hands-on exploration of the framework. Combining short code snippets and an ongoing example developed throughout the book, it shows you how to build simple and efficient J2EE applications.    Inside, you\'ll see how to:    Solve persistence problems  Handle asynchronous messaging  Create and consume remote services  Build web applications  Integrate with most popular web frameworks  In short, you\'ll learn how to use Spring to write simpler, easier to maintain code so that you can focus on what really matters   your critical business needs.    The revised Third Edition explores the core Spring Framework issues, as well as the latest updates to other Spring portfolio projects such as Spring WebFlow and Spring Security. The result is a book that\'s both broader and deeper than previous editions. You\'ll learn the full range of new features available with Spring 3, including:    More annotation-oriented options to reduce the amount of XML configuration  Full-featured support for REST  A new Spring Expression Language (SpEL) that makes short work of wiring complex values.

Its unique blend of a complete, lightweight container that allows you to build a complex application from loosely-coupled POJOs and a set of easily understood abstractions that simplify construction, testing, and deployment make Spring both powerful and easy-to-use   a hard-to-beat combination. With this power comes the potential for a wide range of uses in both common and not-so-common scenarios. That\'s where Spring in Practice comes in.    Unlike the many books that teach you what Spring is, Spring in Practice shows you how to tackle the challenges you face when you build Spring-based applications. The book empowers software developers to solve concrete business problems \"the Spring way\" by mapping application-level issues to Spring-centric solutions.    Spring in Practice diverges from other cookbooks because it presents the background you need to understand the domain in which a solution applies before it offers the specific steps to solve the problem. You\'re never left with the feeling that you understand the answer, but find the question irrelevant. You can put the book to immediate use even if you don\'t have deep knowledge of every part of Spring Framework.    The book divides into three main parts. In Part 1, you\'ll get a rapid overview of Spring Framework   enough to get you started if you\'re new and a great refresher for readers who already have a few Spring cycles. Part 2 provides techniques that are likely to be useful no matter what type of application you\'re building. You\'ll find discussions of topics like user accounts, security, site navigation, and application diagnosis.    Part 3 provides domain-specific recipes. Here, you\'ll find practical solutions to realistic and interesting business problems. For example, this part discusses Spring-based approaches for ecommerce, lead generation, and CRM.    There are several recurring themes throughout Spring in Practice, including Spring MVC, Hibernate, and transactions. Each recipe is an opportunity to highlight something new or interesting about Spring, and to focus on that concept in detail.    This book assumes you have a good foundation in Java and Java EE. Prior exposure to Spring Framework is helpful, but not required.', '2013-05-09 07:00:00');
